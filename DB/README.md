Databases
======

You can download the data for running all the models in the zenodo link (X).
Due to size constrains, the datafiles are not uploaded to this GitHub repo.

In most cases, the preprocessed databases are also given.
However, in the ```Code/```  folder you can find the Code needed for preprocessing some of the databases.

## Information about the datasets

In the ```Data/``` folder all the datasets employed in this work can be found in their respective folder:
 - DrugBank. DTIs collected from DrugBank Database Release 5.1.9 [https://go.drugbank.com/](https://go.drugbank.com/). We do not provide the xml files from which we extrated the data because of licensing issues. However, we do provide the DTIs extracted from it, already curated by us. 
 - BIOSNAP. Dataset created by Stanford Biomedical Network Dataset Collection. It contains proteins targeted by drugs on the U.S. market from DrugBank release 5.0.0 using MINER. [https://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/](https://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/).
 - BindingDB.  Data employed in this work was the one corresponding to the downloaded from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) [https://tdcommons.ai/](https://tdcommons.ai/), however we also provide the data from the original dataset [https://www.bindingdb.org/rwd/bind/index.jsp](https://www.bindingdb.org/rwd/bind/index.jsp). 
 - Davis_et_al
 - Yamanashi_et_al_GoldStandard.
 

Further, in the folder ```cross_side_information_DB``` you can find the datasets used as complementary data to the drug-targer interactions (DTIs) in several models. Inside, you will find the following:
 - CTD.
 - FDA
 - STITCH
 - ChemBL
 - HPRD
 - bioMART
 - DrugBank
 - DrugBank_FDA
 - SIDER

Databases
======

You can download the data for running all the models in the zenodo link (X).
Due to size constrains, the datafiles are not uploaded to this GitHub repo.

In most cases, the preprocessed databases are also given.
However, in the ```Code/```  folder you can find the Code needed for preprocessing some of the databases.
